# 🚨 WELCOME CRM - AI BEHAVIOR RULES 🚨

## 1. MANDATORY INITIALIZATION (DO THIS FIRST)
At the start of EVERY session, you MUST:
1. Read `docs/SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md`.
2. Output the following checklist to the user to prove you read it:
   - [ ] Read `docs/SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md`
   - [ ] Checked for recent schema changes not yet documented

## 2. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
`docs/SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md` is the absolute authority.
- If code contradicts it -> Flag to user.
- If you change DB/Logic -> **YOU MUST UPDATE IT**.

## 3. DEFINITION OF DONE
No task is complete until you have asked yourself:
**"Did I change the DB schema, business rules, or architecture?"**
- **YES**: Update `docs/SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md` immediately.
- **NO**: Proceed.

## 4. CRITICAL PROTOCOLS
- **Activities**: Historical only. Never create future activities.
- **Tasks**: The only future-facing entity.
- **Design**: Premium, Glassmorphism, Tailwind. No native inputs.
- **Database**: "Database as the Brain". Use triggers/functions over frontend logic.
- **Safety**: Never guess columns. Run `\d table` or check schema first.
